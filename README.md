SmartChain: Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Retail Supply Chains

SmartChain is a reinforcement learning (RL) powered simulation that optimizes inventory distribution across a retail supply chain of warehouses and stores â€” **even under disruptions**.

Built using Python, Streamlit, and Stable-Baselines3, this project showcases how smart agents can reduce stockouts, prevent over-supply, and outperform traditional random policies in dynamic environments.

## Project Overview

Retail supply chains face unpredictable demand, transportation delays, and facility disruptions. Traditional systems often struggle to adapt in real time.

**SmartChain** introduces an intelligent agent using the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm to:

- Learn optimal shipment strategies from warehouses to stores
- Handle fluctuating demand and warehouse outages
- Minimize stockouts and avoid excess inventory
- Continuously improve through simulation-based feedback
